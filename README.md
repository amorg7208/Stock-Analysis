# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Refractor VBA code to collect stock information in two years (2017, 2018) and determine if they are worth investing in. The process was originally created in a lengthier format but the intention of this is to increase efficiency in the code. 

## Results

### Analysis

I started by copying the .vbs script into VBA and looking over the dataset to familiarize myself with the data. The code to write the inputbox, worksheet activation, headers, ticker arrays and cell formatting were already complete. A pseudocode was included to structure and complete the task. Please see the included image below for coding specifics.

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refractoring code?
Refractoring code leads to improved software design and a cleaner, easier to read code; this is important when others view our work. Refractoring provides an increased ability to debug and fix errors that may otherwise lengthen the time spent on a project. Overall, refractoring leads to faster programming time and increased efficiency. However, one needs to be cautious when refractoring code as it can lead to an increase in errors when working with large data sets, or when the user is unfamiliar with the process. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The biggest take away from refractoring this code is the increase in speed it took to run the macros. Please see the included images showcasing the respective speeds for each years' data.
